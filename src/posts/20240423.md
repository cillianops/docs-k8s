## Kubernetes version 1.30 finally supports true read-only volume mounting

I recently checked the k8s official website blog and found this content. I would like to share it with you here:

The new feature introduced in Kubernetes 1.30 solves a long-standing problem: under certain conditions, volume mounts marked as read-only are not fully read-only. The new `recursiveReadOnly` option allows users to ensure that all submounts under a specified mount point are read-only, which is a big step towards ensuring file system security within the container. While this feature is currently in alpha testing, it demonstrates the Kubernetes community's continued commitment to improving container runtime security and reliability, and may become part of the default configuration in the future as this feature matures and stabilizes. For those users who have special needs for Kubernetes security, this will be an update worth paying attention to and trying.
In a Kubernetes environment, when you mount a volume into a container and mark it as read-only by setting `readOnly: true`, the purpose of this setting is to prevent processes within the container from modifying these mounted file systems. However, under certain conditions, this read-only setting is not completely absolute. The reason mainly involves how to handle submounts or mount inheritance.

The core of the problem lies in how Linux file system mounts work and how Kubernetes handles them. When you have a mount point on the host and there are other mount points (i.e. child mounts) under this mount point, the behavior of these child mount points will not automatically inherit the behavior of the parent mount point. Read-only property. This means that even if a parent mount point is set to read-only in the Kubernetes pod configuration, its child mount points may still be writable unless those child mount points are also explicitly set to read-only.
For example, if you have a mount point `/mnt`, it is set to read-only in the container. However, if there is a sub-mount point `/mnt/my-nfs-server` under `/mnt`, and this sub-mount point is writable on the host, then within the container, even though `/mnt` Files and directories under cannot be modified (in line with the read-only setting), but the write operation to `/mnt/my-nfs-server` may succeed because its read-only attribute is not recursively applied to all sub-mount points .

This is why Kubernetes 1.30 introduced the `recursiveReadOnly` option, which allows explicit settings when defining volume mounts to ensure that all child mount points inherit the read-only attribute, thereby achieving a true read-only mount and solving the problem. restrictions under this particular condition.


Original content: https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/04/23/recursive-read-only-mounts/
Read-only volume mounts have been a feature of Kubernetes since its inception. But surprisingly, read-only mounts on Linux are not entirely read-only under certain conditions. Starting with v1.30, they can be set to be fully read-only, while support for recursive read-only mounts is in alpha.

Read-only volume mounts are not truly read-only by default, and volume mounts can be surprisingly complex.

You might expect the following manifest to make everything under /mnt in the container read-only:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
Kind: Pod
spec:
  volumes:
    -name: mnt
      hostPath:
        path: /mnt
  containers:
    -volumeMounts:
        -name: mnt
          mountPath: /mnt
          readOnly: true
However, any submounts located under /mnt may still be writable! For example, if /mnt/my-nfs-server on the host is writable, write operations to /mnt/*within the container will be rejected, but write operations to /mnt/my-nfs-server/*will be rejected. Still feasible.

New mount option: recursiveReadOnly Kubernetes 1.30 adds a new mount option recursiveReadOnly to make submounts recursively read-only.

This option can be enabled as follows:

---
apiVersion: v1
Kind: Pod
spec:
  volumes:
    -name: mnt
      hostPath:
        path: /mnt
  containers:
    -volumeMounts:
        -name: mnt
          mountPath: /mnt
          readOnly: true
          # Add
# Possible values â€‹â€‹are `Enabled`, `IfPossible`, and `Disabled`.
          # Needs to be specified with `readOnly: true`.
          recursiveReadOnly: Enabled
This is accomplished by applying the MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY attribute using the mount_setattr(2) function and the AT_RECURSIVE flag (added in Linux kernel v5.12).

For backward compatibility, the recursiveReadOnly field is not a replacement for readOnly but is intended to be used in conjunction with it. To get a correct recursive read-only mount, you must set both fields.

Feature availability To enable recursiveReadOnly mounts, the following components must be used:

-Kubernetes: v1.30 or higher, requires the RecursiveReadOnlyMounts feature gating to be enabled. Starting with v1.30, this gate is marked as alpha.

-CRI runtime: -containerd: v2.0 or higher

-OCI runtime: -runc: v1.1 or higher -crun: v1.8.6 or higher

-Linux kernel: v5.12 or higher ```
